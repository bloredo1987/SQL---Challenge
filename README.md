# SQL---Challenge

-This project involved taking employee data from the company during teh 19980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files. 

-For this project, I designed the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data by performing data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.
